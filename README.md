**Unheard Echoes to Rising Voices: Understanding the Shift in Crime Reporting Post-Nirbhaya**

_The research paper is submitted as a end of course individual study on a real dataset, to Massimiliano Bratti,  Professor of Economics at the Department of Economics, Management, and Quantitative Methods  (DEMM) of the University of Milan._

_This study applies the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to estimate the impact of the 2012 Nirbhaya case and the subsequent legal reforms on the reported incidence of rapes in Delhi, India. The Nirbhaya case, which led to significant changes in India's laws regarding sexual violence, serves as the treatment event. Using data from 2004 to 2015, I compare the post-treatment trends in Delhi with those of a synthetic control constructed from a weighted average of other Indian states. Key predictors, including literacy growth rate, per capita income (current and constant), are employed to build the synthetic control. A difference-in-differences (DID) approach is used to examine the gaps between Delhi and its synthetic counterpart in the pre- and post-treatment periods, where I show that the reporting of crimes has increased significantly after the event._


Note: The "Master Sheet "file includes data for crimes against women and the data on "Murders" which were processed using excel, and data was collected from online data.gov.in portal.
